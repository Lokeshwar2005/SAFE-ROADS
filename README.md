Introduction

With the growing number of vehicles on the road and the increasing frequency of
accidents, modern cities face immense challenges in maintaining road safety and
ensuring smooth traffic flow. In response to these challenges, Safe Roads is
developed as an intelligent traffic and accident management system that utilizes
real-time data, AI, and intuitive design to enhance urban mobility and safety.

The Safe Roads Android application offers a comprehensive set of features to
assist both commuters and authorities in navigating traffic and responding to road
incidents efficiently. Users can access Traffic Updates by simply entering a
location, enabling them to view congestion levels and plan their travel accordingly.
The Navigation feature allows users to input their source and destination to
receive the best possible route with minimal traffic, promoting time-efficient and
stress-free travel.

To support road safety and rapid incident response, the app includes an Accident
Reporting module where users can provide details such as the date, time, and
location of an accident. These reports are then made available through the Incident
Reports section, helping others stay informed about recent road incidents.
Additionally, the Road Safety Measures section features visually engaging
infographics that educate users on essential safety practices and guidelines.
In emergencies, quick access to help is crucial. The app’s Emergency Contacts
feature consolidates all key service numbers—such as police, ambulance, and fire
services—and allows users to initiate a call directly through the dial pad with a
single tap.

Safe Roads aims to combine smart features with practical usability to make roads
safer, traffic smarter, and help more accessible—ultimately contributing to a more
secure and efficient urban transport environment.
